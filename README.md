# BinaryTreeSim
A simple simulator for binary hash trees when used for revocation purposes. This is the case, for example, of the Activation Codes for Pseudonym Certificates (ACPC) solution, developed for use in vehicular communications and described in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adhoc.2018.07.007

The main purpose of this source code is to enable reproducibility of the experimental results described in the "Revocation in Vehicular Public Key Infrastructures: balancing privacy and efficiency" academic paper (to be published).
